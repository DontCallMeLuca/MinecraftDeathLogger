I'm too lazy to make a release for this, so I just put the binary
in the `/bin` directory
<br>
You can then just drag and drop it in your server's /Plugins directory

## Notes
- This plugin was made a long time ago, it should still work fine in later versions though
- The original API version supported for this plugin is 1.20
